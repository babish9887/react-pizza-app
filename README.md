# React + Vite

This template provides a minimal setup to get React working in Vite with HMR and some ESLint rules.

Currently, two official plugins are available:

- [@vitejs/plugin-react](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react/blob/main/packages/plugin-react/README.md) uses [Babel](https://babeljs.io/) for Fast Refresh
- [@vitejs/plugin-react-swc](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react-swc) uses [SWC](https://swc.rs/) for Fast Refresh

Day 28 of #100DaysChallenge🚀 

Today I delved into React Router DOM and expanded my knowledge on creating dynamic and nested routes for my new Project. Here's a summary of what I learned:

1️⃣ createBrowserRouter: Set up routing.
2️⃣ Nested Routes: Organized routes hierarchically.
3️⃣ Hooks: Explored useNavigation, useLoaderData, and useActionData.
4️⃣ Form Handling: Managed forms with <Form>.
5️⃣ Dynamic Params: Utilized dynamic params like :orderId.




🎉 Day 31 of my 100 Days Challenge Update 🎉

Big milestone today! Successfully implemented Redux Toolkit in my project for managing cart functionality. Updating and deleting items has never been smoother. 💼💨
